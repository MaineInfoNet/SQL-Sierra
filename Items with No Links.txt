##Since it’s not possible to search for item records with no links in Create Lists, 
##I decided to work up something in SQL. The following query brings up 6 records 
##on our system:...Of course, the only thing I can think of to do with these is 
##simply ask Innovative to delete them, as there’s no link to a bib and so it’s  
##unlikely we’ll find where they actually belong… Only one of them even has a barcode.
